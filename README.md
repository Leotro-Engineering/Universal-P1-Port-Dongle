# Universal P1 Port Dongle
The Universal P1 Port Dongle is a multifunctional Wi-Fi and USB development dongle for communicating with the P1 port of a smart meter. The module is based on an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, which is easily programmable via the USB port. Unique to this module is its P1 port input and output, allowing it to not only receive but also transmit information. This feature allows the dongle to be used in various ways:

- P1 to USB dongle
- P1 to Wi-Fi dongle
- Wireless P1 connection (for example, between the smart meter and a (smart) electric vehicle charger further away)
- Wireless P1 splitter (if multiple smart devices need to use the P1 data)
